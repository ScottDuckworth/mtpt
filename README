mtpt, or Multi-Threaded Path Traversal tools, is a set of tools for UNIX-like
systems that are focused on manipulating large numbers of files and optimized
for file systems which can read or write multiple files at a time (e.g.
distributed file systems or file systems residing on RAID arrays).

mtpt tools use multiple threads for directory traversal and for operating on
individual files.  The effects of this typically includes higher resource
utilization and shorter completion times.

mtsync
------

files.

mtrm
----

Recursively deletes files and directories.  Similar to rm -rf.

mtoutliers
-----

Finds files or directories that stand out in their directory by size, either
greater than or less than some factor of the average size.
