mtpt, or Multi-Threaded Path Traversal tools, is a set of tools for UNIX-like
systems that are focused on manipulating large numbers of files and optimized
for file systems which can read or write multiple files at a time (e.g.
distributed file systems or file systems residing on RAID arrays).

mtpt tools use multiple threads for directory traversal and for operating on
individual files.  The effects of this typically includes higher resource
utilization and shorter completion times.

mtsync
------

Used to synchronize one directory with another.  Similar to rsync, but it only
works with local files, and with fewer bells and whistles.
