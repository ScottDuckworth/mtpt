psync is a tool that can be used to synchronize one directory with another,
similar to rsync, but it only works with local files.  psync can be faster
than rsync, especially when dealing with RAID arrays or distributed file
systems, because multiple operations can be going on simultaneously.  Even
when differences between the directories are sparse, psync can be faster than
rsync because the directory traversal itself is run over multiple threads.
